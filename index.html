			<h2> Hello, </h2>
			
			<p> My name is Adil. I am a first year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo.
			Back when I was in high school, I used to play quite a lot of football. However, ever since university 
			started, the only exercise I get is walking from one class to another. I never take the elevator because
			I want to climb the ladder to success. </p>
			
			
			<p> My interests include programming, listening to music, and binge watching TV shows. I particularly enjoy Suits and 
			Silicon Valley.I'm also interested in the AI field of Computer Science.</p>
