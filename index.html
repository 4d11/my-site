			<h2> Hello, </h2>
			
			<p> My name is Adil. I am a first year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo.
			Back when I was in high school, I used to play quite a lot of football. However, ever since university 
			started, the only exercise I get is walking from one class to another. I never take the elevator because
			I want to climb the ladder to success. </p>
			
			<p> I like cheesy jokes and cheesy pizza. I just like cheese. Cheese is good.
				I basically like food. If you have any extra food lying around I will eat it.
				I am not a picky eater.</p>
			
			<p> When I'm not eating, I usually like to sleep. Haha jk I'm in university.
				I don't sleep.</p>
				
			<p> Other than food, I also really enjoy programming, but only when my code works.
			Otherwise, I just stare intensely at my computer screen trying to figure out why my
			program won't work, muttering the occasional swear words. But eventually, when I do 
			find a solution, I just feel amazing. I feel like Neo in the Matrix. That's why I love
			Computer Science. I feel like a baws. </p>
